                <h3>Nixon at the Threshold of the Lincoln Memorial</h3>

<p style="margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem">
  <em>
    <small><small>13 January 2019</small></small>
  </em>
</p>

<p>What language could there have been<br />
between that tiger, battle-scarred,<br />
and these young cubs, German-tongued<br />
and fearful offspring of Philosophy in ruins?</p>

<p>Ah, one tries to merge with Being as the sky collapses.<br />
Those with thorny crowns spy deep oppression.</p>

<p>Nixon mutters, “What is there to save?”<br />
allows no motion, grins a grin that says<br />
“All shall be well, stop feeling.”</p>

<p>This has happened before.</p>

<p>I stood there as a child<br />
repeating “up steps!” in innocence,<br />
for I had not yet learned what there is said<br />
of History or Freedom,<br />
or the other vague ideas men have died for.</p>

<p>I was born too late for that,<br />
and though things have not changed<br />
some hope, yes, even now,<br />
though with less force,<br />
for some renewal,<br />
this time unendorsed.</p>

<p>It will not come on wings<br />
or save us, probably,<br />
but it could make things better,<br />
keep them moving.</p>

<p>And as for the children, well,<br />
they’ve never mattered much to us,<br />
and who could build a home from such raw material?</p>
