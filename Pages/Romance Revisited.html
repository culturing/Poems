</p>

<p>Unsurprised when she appeared<br />
atop the stair,<br />
unsought and yet on cue,<br />
I smiled.</p>

<p>There we were again.</p>

<p>More than sounds were heard,<br />
more said than words<br />
as we relieved the burn<br />
that itched for all those years.</p>

<p>Something in that breeze<br />
put love at ease,<br />
and all those memories<br />
in Sunday Best conceived<br />
some reparation,<br />
some demand.</p>

<p>But lives diverge,<br />
conform to their courses,<br />
drive towards their ends.</p>

<p>This, then, too must end.</p>

<hr />

<p>But if we flee from time,<br />
abandon all but dreams,</p>

<p>Elide the pulls of Jupiter<br />
and Venus,</p>

<p>Would we weary of the world weâ€™d made?</p>

<p>Must immortal Love's embrace<br />
ignore all time and place?</p>

<hr />

<p>Rage for futility,<br />
Rage for bleared horizons,</p>

<p>For rage itself,<br />
which vanquishes sages,<br />
and for the mortal dream.</p>

<p>But though to many moons I've sighed,<br />
and though those eyes when met with mine<br />
still come to life to think of all that was<br />
and what could be, it is not time.</p>

<p>Though it is right.</p>

<p>For time flows suddenly to exit youth.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let us go then, you and I,<br />
to die, and not trace ways<br />
across that sky<br />
where the Immortals lie.</p>

<p>We belong implanted<br />
where the bloom that Spring provides<br />
by Autumn flees, and we get by<br />
on hardened leaves.</p>
