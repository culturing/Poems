                <h3>The New Bird</h3>

<p style="margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem">
  <em>
    <small><small>09 March 2019</small></small>
  </em>
</p>

<p>The idea waits upon a bough.<br />
The bird is in the parlor though.<br />
Tomorrow never comes for us,<br />
and so he sings for now.</p>

<p>But over in the city though<br />
the trees all stand erect,<br />
where there is no sought communion<br />
and the love is all in trust.</p>

<p>I do not speak for them,<br />
and only know the words I know.<br />
But for who would still hear,<br />
I have endeavored to show how.</p>

<hr />

<p>Idea waits upon a bough.<br />
The bird is in the parlor though.<br />
Tomorrow has not come,<br />
and so he sings for now.</p>

<p>But over in the city now,<br />
the steel trees stand erect,<br />
and there is no more communion<br />
where all love is held in trust.</p>

<p>The song is not for those<br />
who sing of things one cannot know.<br />
The new bird sings, alas!<br />
for those who have no other sound.</p>

<hr />

<p>Idea stoops upon a bough.<br />
The bird has left the parlor now.<br />
Tomorrow came and went,<br />
But his song still is ringing here.</p>

<p>For over near the capital,<br />
The trees fall circumspect,<br />
And all the old songs of communion<br />
Are not something we can trust.</p>

<p>The song, what song, whose singing?<br />
Let us know the things we know.<br />
For after all has come and gone,<br />
We still are earthen bound.</p>
