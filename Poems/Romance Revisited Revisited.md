I saw you there\
atop the stair,\
it’s true,

And you were me\
and I was you,

And ocean blue\
bore love away.

It chastened him right through.

Alas! they say\
it is no use to sing,

But I’ll take wing, for lo! \
Minerva’s owl has perched\
upon a husk, a lifeless stump,

and there will be no going on\
without new songs from flesh and blood.
