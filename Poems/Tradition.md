I think the future \
does not belong to the past,\
and things are passing,\
present and future.

I think things will not last;\
though nothing does,\
those less than most\
which grow from baseless ground,

things passing all around,\
and we do well to grasp\
for any which are present,\
future or past,

those most the old things \
which are known to last.
