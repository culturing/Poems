I would like to see  
science and technology,  
like religion, kept separate  
from government  
and the lives of regular people,  
who cannot understand  
the implications, the power,  
the ideas embedded therein,  
and are harmed,  
who cannot make themselves  
from steel, let alone make their world,  
and who must let things be.  
This means letting them fade.  
It's true, science has parts to play,  
small ones, since stems  
without roots surely wither,  
but the point is to till the new soil  
'til the new crop comes in.
