From Hegel's brain  
thou, spluttering,  
spreadst thy wings.  

Thou art one more  
mythology,  
nothing more.  

Thou cannot transcend  
culture, or fly  
as Zeitgeist.  

No, thy thinking is  
primitive, alas,  
just like thy body.  

So give up the geist.  
Make way for some new  
mode of knowing,  

Or rather, some old,  
deep-rooted thought, the kind  
you were made to destroy.
