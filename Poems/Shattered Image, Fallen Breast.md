At midnight in the basement  
of a museum, some forgotten grotto  
deep in Mediterranean soil,  

I walked slow and silent,  
deep in thought,  

When lo! the image of a woman,  
be it Aphrodite, Juno,  
or some other, rose before me.  

I came to her side  
and noticed lying at her feet  
a fallen breast of stone,  
hers surely, lying prone,  
as though some vandal  
made her pure.  

I put it back in place
and held it there,  
until her firmness made me sure,  

But sure of what,  
I do not know.  

I thought I could discern  
the faintest sigh,  
but only she would know  
who fills the mind with wonder,  

so I wondered  
if the earth could be her home,  
or if she comes from some far-whispered plane  
that only poets know.
