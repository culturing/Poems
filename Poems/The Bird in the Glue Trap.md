It wasn't meant for you,\
that much is clear. But how\
those little wings beat such\
a fearsome rhythm \
just to pull you \
those two-hundred bird-lengths,\
sticky trap in tow,\
I'll never know,

Or how you ripped your body free\
to soar on lighter wing.

Ah, those feathers left behind\
were not worth dying over.

I am only glad, my friend,\
that I did not extinguish you\
to put an end to pain.
