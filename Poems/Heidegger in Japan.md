*For John Rawls*

What a journey,\
eastward\
to a land no less\
devoted to its nothingness\
than Martinâ€™s own,

and yet one prone\
to wholeness nonetheless.

How much to learn,\
to see,\
and maybe dream\
on long-abandoned beaches\
near the silent sea.

Old Martin,\
having conquered Europe,\
set his sights on Asia,\
found himself there, conquered,\
none the wiser,

Then returning to a Europe\
plain and bright, devout\
but dour in appearance\
as in mind,

what did he hope to find?

No more the plainly spoken\
One, to rule us all, no more!

But maybe\
some forgiveness\
for us, mortals after all.
