### The New Bird

The idea waits upon a bough.\
The bird is in the parlor though.\
Tomorrow never comes for us,\
and so he sings for now.

But over in the city though\
the trees all stand erect,\
where there is no sought communion\
and the love is all in trust.

I do not speak for them,\
and only know the words I know.\
But for who would still hear,\
I have endeavored to show how.

Idea waits upon a bough.\
The bird is in the parlor though.\
Tomorrow has not come,\
and so he sings for now.

But over in the city now,\
the steel trees stand erect,\
and there is no more communion\
where all love is held in trust.

The song is not for those\
who sing of things one cannot know.\
The new bird sings, alas!\
for those who have no other sound.

---

Idea stoops upon a bough. \
The bird has left the parlor now. \
Tomorrow came and went, \
But his song still is ringing here.

For over near the capital, \
The trees fall circumspect, \
And all the old songs of communion \
Are not something we can trust.

The song, what song, whose singing? \
Let us know the things we know. \
For after all has come and gone, \
We still are earthen bound.
