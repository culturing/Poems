The words tumble  
down, jumbled,  
stumble over  
bumps and rumble  
into town, past  
rows of corn that  
wonder at the world.  

I wonder what the world means.  

Someone asks me why I choose these words.  
I say these words choose me.  

And when they ask directions,  
well, I think the words are lost,  
and I must find them.  

I must guide them.
