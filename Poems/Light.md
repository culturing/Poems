At a red light,  
when there is no cross-traffic,  
a silence deepens  
like the space between man and God.  

How stupid it feels,  
to wait for nothing.  

According to some theologians,  
God occupies space *above* beings,  
and waits for us there,  
as the father of light.  

But I prefer when the light changes  
and things keep moving.
