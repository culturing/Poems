The bird has a story.  
It sounds like a song.  
But I wouldn't worry.  
He wouldn't sing long.  
  
The people are coming.  
They haven't a care.  
The people are stunning.  
The bird wouldn't dare.  
  
The people make sausage.  
What else could they do?  
Their story is ugly,  
But this much is true:  
  
The bird has to learn how to live with clipped wings.  
Indeed, this may be why he sings.
