Thunders crash,\
The wind moves through the leaves,

The paths grow walls,\
curve into cages,

Thunder asks,\
A certain volume of man,\
suffices?

No, it never suffices,

Always more\
past overflowing

Thunder crashes,\
Floods tear down the trees,

The wind moves through the leaves,\
A certain volume of man,\
so certain

Thunder, why \
O thunder

move through wind and leaves.
