If Nietzsche were asked,  
"Why power?"  

He might reply,  
"We grow helpless."  

But humans  
have always been helpless,  
are helpless  
for decades at least,  
and even then will need food.  

What purpose has power,  
if not to supply  
our infirmities?  

Oh, but how free we would be,  
to be free, very free!  

To not be born of woman,  
no more of a people  
in time and place.  

I beg you, dear reader,  
be cautious, and do not embark  
on a journey that ends in death.
