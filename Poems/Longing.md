I long for things I've never known.\
The shadows curse my eyes.\
The scars run deep. They run at least to bone.

And though thunder grants atonement,\
Questions always come from other skies.\
I long for things I've never known,

And candles burn and scholars moan,\
And ashes creep beneath the tightest mind.\
The scars are deep like bone,

And all the ancient empty tomes\
Provide no lasting prize,\
But point to things we cannot know.

To ache for bluer skies,\
To ache for home,\
To scars that run through bone,\
To longing as the only thing we know.
