### Longing

I long for things I've never known.\
The shadows curse my eyes.\
The scars run deep. They run at least to bone.

And though thunder grants atonement,\
Always questions come from other skies.\
I long for things I've never known,

And candles burn and scholars moan\
And ashes creep beneath the tightest mind.\
The scars are deep like bone,

And all the ancient empty tomes\
Provide no lasting prize.\
They point to things we cannot know.

From ache for bluer skies,\
To ache for home,\
To scars that run through bone,\
The longing is the only thing we know.
