### For an Old Lover

I held you in a dream-worn land\
and felt upon this hand\
a subtle war that ne'er was sparked by man\
but burned in this mind's eye.

Surer forms of idol worship \
walk just like a woman, but are tenderer,\
and spirit us forgotten things,\
and give us ghostly wings.

Lover, you know beauty flies.\
Enclose again within my soul\
that morsel of eternal grace\
you burned in this mindâ€™s eye.
